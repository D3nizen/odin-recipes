        <p>Everyone will love this cowboy spaghetti, a fun twist with bacon, cheese, and pasta in a spicy beef and tomato sauce. The best part is that it’s a one-dish meal, cooked in a cast iron skillet.</p>
        <h3>ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>6 strips bacon</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>8 ounces spaghetti noodles</li>
        <li>1 can diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 can tomato sauce</li>
        <li>3 green onions, sliced</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place bacon in a large cast iron skillet and cook over medium-high heat, until slightly crisp. Crumble roughly and set aside.</li>
        <li>Add onion to the same skillet with bacon grease and sauté until softened. Add garlic, salt, and pepper. Stir until garlic is fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add ground beef. Cook and stir until beef is crumbly and no longer pink.</li>
        <li>Break spaghetti noodles in half. Scatter over ground beef, making sure noodles are separated. Pour tomatoes with green chiles, fire-roasted tomatoes, and tomato sauce over noodles.</li>
        <li>Remove the lid and stir to combine the pasta and sauce. Smooth out mixture and scatter shredded cheese evenly over top. Sprinkle with remaining bacon.</li>
    </ol>
