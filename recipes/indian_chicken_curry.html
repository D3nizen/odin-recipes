    <h2>An amazing dish that will make your taste buds go crazy!</h2>
        <p>Indian Chicken Curry is a dish that has become one of my favorite dishes to make! The steps are simple to follow and the more you let the curry reduce, the more intense the flavors become! You can make the dish as simple or as complex as you'd like and you will want to make enough to definitely have leftovers for tomorrow!</p>
        <p>Chicken curry from the Indian subcontinent typically features chicken stewed in a tomato-based sauce seasoned with aromatic spices. This recipe, like many others, calls for curry powder (a spice blend made with coriander, turmeric, cumin, and chili powder). You can choose to buy pre made curry powder or purchase curry paste at your local indian grocery!</p>
